    default: In a sci-fi film, Alex is a time traveler who decides to go back in
      time to witness a famous historical battle that took place 100 years ago,
      which lasted for 10 days. He arrives three days before the battle starts.
      However, after spending six days in the past, he jumps forward in time by
      50 years and stays there for 20 days. Then, he travels back to witness the
      end of the battle. How many days does Alex spend in the past before he
      sees the end of the battle?
  expected:
    type: string
    default: Alex spent 33 days in the past before he saw the end of the battle.
