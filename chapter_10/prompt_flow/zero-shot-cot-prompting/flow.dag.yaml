    default: In a complex time travel movie plot, Max, a 25 year old scientist,
      discovers a pattern in historical events that repeats every 40 years. To
      study this pattern, he starts in the year 2300 and travels back in time in
      increments of 40 years. He spends 5 years in each time period studying the
      event. After studying the event in 1900, he jumps forward 80 years to skip
      a cycle and lands in a new time period. In what year does he find himself
      after the final jump and how old is he?
  expected:
    type: string
    default: After the final jump, Max finds himself in the year 1980 and he is 75
      years old.
